# Project Plan — Walk in the Word
*Author: Alex Nino | Date: October 3, 2025*

## Risks (TAME)
**T**: New to GitHub Pages → follow setup guide  
**A**: Audience prefers short weekly studies → test with peers  
**M**: Tone/visuals may not resonate → adjust after feedback  
**E**: Time constraints → lock scope to 2 pages + docs

## WBS & Schedule
1) Repo & README (0.5d)  
2) Docs: scope/plan/retro (1d)  
3) Prototype pages + CSS (1d)  
4) Publish on Pages + test (0.5d)  
5) Retrospective (0.5d)

## Definition of Done
- 2 pages live, shared CSS, docs complete, README includes live link
